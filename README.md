# Budget Tracker

## Description

This app allows someone to track their withdrawals and deposists with or without a data/internet connection so that they can keep track of their account balances while traveling. It's a functioning PWA that also notes inputs of their transactions and submits them to the database once data/internet connection has been reestablished.
